Compilation:
    This program was compiled on gl15 using C++11 and libpng.

Running:
    To run this program, use the following command.
    $ ./rt [path/to/scene]

The program can also be run with a number of arguments to change program behaviour. Those possible options are:
    "-d" - Instead of performing full raytracing, simply draw a greyscale image where the colour of each pixel is based off of the depth of each pixel. This option disables most other options.
    "-ss [num]" - Enables supersampling with num^2 samples performed per pixel. Samples are taken from the center of each cell in a uniform grid in the pixel.
    "-st [num]" - Enabled stochastic sampling with num^2 samples performed per pixel. Samples are taken from a random point in each cell in a uniform grid in the pixel.
    "-w [width]" - Overrides the image width specified in the scene lua
    "-h [height]" - Overrides the image height specified in the scene lua
    "-b [sphere/box]" - Changes the bounding volumes of meshes to be a sphere or an axis aligned box. If this option isn't specified, a box is used.
    "-db <sphere/box>" - Enables the drawing of bounding volumes instead of meshes. If sphere or box is specified, sets the type of bounding volume used as if -b was specified.
    "-a/-na" - Enables or disables ambient light calculations. Ambient lighting is enabled by default.
    "-d/-nd" - Enables or disables diffuse light calculations. Diffuse lighting is enabled by default.
    "-s/-ns" - Enabled or disables specular light calculations. Specular lighting is enabled by default.

Additional Features:
    -To enable 3x supersampling, run the program with the following command:
    $ ./rt -ss 3 [path/to/scene]
    -To enable 3x stochastic sampling, run the program with the following command:
    $ ./rt -st 3 [path/to/scene]
